# Q1: `int three_d_array[3][2][2] = {2,5,7,9,3,4,6,1,0,8,11,13};` in this array how `three_d_array[0][0]` equal `&three_d_array[0][0]`

In C, the reason why `three_d_array[0][0]` is equal to `&three_d_array[0][0]` is due to how arrays and pointers behave.

Let's break this down:

1. **Array Name as a Pointer**:
   - In most contexts, when you use an array name, it "decays" into a pointer to its first element. For example, `three_d_array[0]` is treated as a pointer to the first 2D array (a `2x2` array) within the larger 3D array.
   
2. **two-dimensional Access**:
   - `three_d_array[0][0]` refers to the first 1D array (which is an array of 2 integers). So, `three_d_array[0][0]` is a pointer to this 1D array.

3. **& Operator**:
   - `&three_d_array[0][0]` is the address of the first 1D array within the first 2D array. But since `three_d_array[0][0]` is already a pointer to this 1D array, `&three_d_array[0][0]` gives you the same result.

### What does `three_d_array[0][0]` mean?

`three_d_array[0][0]` is the **first 1D array** within the 3D array. It's an array of two integers, so:

- `three_d_array[0][0]` points to the first element of this 1D array (which is `2` in your example).
- The type of `three_d_array[0][0]` is `int*`.

### What does `&three_d_array[0][0]` mean?

`&three_d_array[0][0]` is asking for the **address** of the first 1D array within the first 2D array. But because `three_d_array[0][0]` already points to the first 1D array, this operation gives you the same pointer as `three_d_array[0][0]`.

### Why are they equal?

Both `three_d_array[0][0]` and `&three_d_array[0][0]` result in the same pointer because `three_d_array[0][0]` is already a pointer to the first element in the array, and using `&` doesn't change that, as it returns the same base address.

In summary:
- `three_d_array[0][0]` is a pointer to the first element in the 1D array.
- `&three_d_array[0][0]` is the address of the first 1D array, which ends up being the same as `three_d_array[0][0]`.

Thus, `three_d_array[0][0] == &three_d_array[0][0]`.

# Q2: and why `three_d_array` equal `&three_d_array`

In C, the reason why `three_d_array` is equal to `&three_d_array` is due to how arrays and pointers are treated when it comes to memory addresses and array names. Let's break this down.

### 1. Array Name as a Pointer:
- In most contexts, an array name (like `three_d_array`) is treated as a pointer to the first element of the array.
- So, `three_d_array` is essentially a pointer to the first element of the 3D array. Specifically, it points to the entire first 2D array (since it's a 3D array, the first "element" is a 2D array).
- The type of `three_d_array` is `int[3][2][2]` (array of 3 arrays of 2 arrays of 2 integers), but it decays to `int (*)[2][2]`, which is a pointer to a 2x2 array of integers.

### 2. Address of the Array (`&three_d_array`):
- `&three_d_array` is the address of the entire array itself.
- In this case, the address of the array is the same as the address of its first element, which is the first 2D array.
- The type of `&three_d_array` is `int (*)[3][2][2]`, which is a pointer to the entire 3D array.

### Why are `three_d_array` and `&three_d_array` Equal?

- `three_d_array` points to the first element of the 3D array, which is a 2D array.
- `&three_d_array` points to the entire 3D array itself.
- However, the address of the first element (the first 2D array) is the same as the address of the entire array because arrays are contiguous in memory, and the entire array starts at the same memory location as its first element.

### Difference in Types

Although the **values** of `three_d_array` and `&three_d_array` are the same (the memory address), their **types** are different:

- `three_d_array` is of type `int (*)[2][2]` (pointer to the first 2D array).
- `&three_d_array` is of type `int (*)[3][2][2]` (pointer to the entire 3D array).

### Example to Illustrate:

```c
int three_d_array[3][2][2] = {2,5,7,9,3,4,6,1,0,8,11,13};

printf("%p\n", (void*)three_d_array);  // prints the address of the first 2D array
printf("%p\n", (void*)&three_d_array); // prints the address of the entire 3D array
```

Both `three_d_array` and `&three_d_array` will print the same address because they both refer to the same memory locationâ€”the beginning of the array. However, they represent different concepts:
- `three_d_array` points to the first 2D array.
- `&three_d_array` points to the entire 3D array, but since both start at the same address, the printed values are the same.

### Conclusion:
Even though `three_d_array` and `&three_d_array` have different types (and semantics), they point to the same memory location, which is why they are equal in terms of the address they hold.
